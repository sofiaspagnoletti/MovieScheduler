# MovieScheduler

This movie scheduler application was created using Firebase to host the showtime data. This app works by retrieving and manipulating the information provided by the user with Moment.js.

### Getting started
This website was created to provide up-to-date information about multiple movies: their showtimes and minutes remaining until the new showtime starts.
